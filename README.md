# Grim
This is (one day going to be) the compiler for the Grim programming language. Grim is general purpose programming language, mainly meant as an education endeavor for myself. Currently I have a lexer, a semi-funcitonal pre-processor, and just a *hint* of a parser.
I realize that this is just the easy stuff, and that a compiler is a huge undertaking, but what else should I be doing with my time?
